Fix and enhance the entire UI of the Pharma Pulse Streamlit application using the PwC brand design.

🔧 Fix the following issues and apply enhancements:

1. 🔒 LOGIN PAGE:
   - Fix: There is a large white block that breaks the layout – remove or properly layer the form container over the background.
   - Fix: Fonts inside the login form are white on white – make text color #333333.
   - Enhancement: Add a background image (use reference image uploaded separately). Ensure the image scales well and keeps the login form centered and readable.
   - Apply: PwC colors:
     - Primary Red: #E03C31
     - Background: #F1F1F1 or semi-transparent over background image
     - Text: #333333
     - Accent Yellow: #FFB612
   - Font: Use "Open Sans" or "Montserrat"
   - Title: "Welcome to Pharma Pulse" – bold, in #E03C31
   - Add light drop shadow and border-radius to input card
   - Ensure mobile and desktop responsiveness

2. 🗃️ UPLOAD PAGE – Schema Display Fix:
   - Fix: The schema section is displaying raw HTML instead of rendering.
   - Fix this by:
     - Wrapping it with `st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)`
     - Ensuring the HTML block renders styled cards for each schema (Products.csv, Authorizations.csv, etc.)
   - Apply proper font color and readable contrast (no #FFF on #F1F1F1)

3. 📝 ACCOUNT PAGE & REPORT PAGE:
   - Ensure all pages use:
     - Background: #F1F1F1
     - Section headers: bold #E03C31
     - Text: #333333
     - Buttons: PwC red with white text, rounded, hover effect (background dark red or border yellow #FFB612)
   - Tables:
     - Light background with red headers
     - Alternating row colors
   - All inputs and forms styled consistently

4. 🌐 SHARED STYLING ACROSS PAGES:
   - Add a centralized CSS block with:
     - Font: "Montserrat", fallback "sans-serif"
     - Button styles
     - Form control styling
     - Card components
   - Use this CSS block inside `st.markdown("""<style>...</style>""", unsafe_allow_html=True)` at the top of every page or shared layout file
   - Add top margin/padding to avoid content overlapping

5. 📱 RESPONSIVENESS:
   - Ensure the login card and forms are centered and scalable on different screen sizes
   - No fixed-width issues
   - Add media queries or use Streamlit container layouts

6. 🖼️ BACKGROUND IMAGE:
   - Add the reference image as a full-screen login background
   - Apply a semi-transparent white or light red overlay behind the login form for readability

7. 🎯 GENERAL POLISH:
   - Avoid hard-coded white (#FFF) text unless background contrast is sufficient
   - Maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and font size
   - Add modern hover effects to buttons and link actions
